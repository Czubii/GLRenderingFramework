# GL Rendering Framework

Simple opengl renderer for upcoming robotic arm controller. Loads a .obj file from build directory and displays it with simple camera controll.

This project was created as part of the Course by Victor Gordan,
so i wanna mention his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8WizezjQVClpWfdKMwtcmw



## How to build
Simply use cmake :)

Also remeber to copy your model (.obj and .mtl) to the build directory. The mesh should be called "mesh.obj", or if you wanna use any other name just modify the main.cpp
