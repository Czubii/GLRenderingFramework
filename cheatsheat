VBO (Vertex Buffer Object): 
Stores vertex data in the GPU.

VAO (Vertex Array Object): 
Stores the configuration of vertex attribute pointers, managing which VBOs and EBOs are used and how.

EBO (Element Buffer Object): 
Stores indices that define the order of vertex rendering, allowing reuse of vertex data.


uniform (variable modifier):
Allows for "communicating", and transfering variables between shaders and CPU code

	// Retrieve the location of the "scale" uniform variable in the shader program.
	// This location is used to set or query the value of the uniform in the shader.
	GLuint UniID = glGetUniformLocation(shaderProgram._ID, "scale");


    shaderProgram.Activate();
	// Set the value of the "scale" uniform variable in the shader program 
	// This updates the shader with the new scale factor for rendering.
    // has to be done after activating the program
	glUniform1f(UniID, scale);
